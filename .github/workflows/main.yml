# Controls when the workflow will run

  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the master branch
  push:
    branches: [ master ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # The first thing we want to do is build on linux
